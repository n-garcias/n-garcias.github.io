            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup> 
            canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) 
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns 
            of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy 
            with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most 
            prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between 
            trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist 
            many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, 
            and research suggests that it might inhibit spread 
            of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
            <sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses 
            and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple
            mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent 
            evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during
            winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness 
            response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
            uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical 
            abrasion.<sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artificially prevented 
            from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy 
            gaps.<sup>[11]</sup>This explains instances of crown shyness 
            between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea 
            cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to 
            this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, 
            and early succession forests where branches are flexible and 
            limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup>
            According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches 
            greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
        </p>

            Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth 
            nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with 
            lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the 
            crown shyness patterns in eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the 
            trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy 
            gaps.<sup>[13]</sup> Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches 
            of<i>Picea sitchensis</i> (Sitka spruce) and <i>Larix kaempferi</i> 
            (Japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which 
            killed the leading shoots.<sup>[10][14]</sup>
        </p>

            A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual 
            light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade 
            avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of 
            plant species.<sup>[15]</sup> Neighbor detection is thought to be a 
            function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the
            proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a
            task widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the 
            phytochrome photoreceptors.<sup>[16]</sup> Many species of plant 
            respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, 
            encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the far-red 
            stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.<sup>[17]</sup>
            Similarly, plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance 
            response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring 
            plants,<sup>[18]</sup> though this was just 
            starting to be recognised in 1988.<sup>[19]</sup>

            The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown 
            shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on 
            well-understood shade avoidance responses.[6][20] Malaysian 
            scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied <i>Dryobalanops aromatica</i>, 
            suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels 
            and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the 
            induced shade.[6][20]

            A 2015 study has suggested that <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> shows 
            different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and 
            unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding 
            kin. This response was shown to be contingent on the proper 
            functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.[21] A 1998 study 
            proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of 
            growth as explanations of crown shyness,[6][20] though a causal 
            link between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be 
            experimentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown 
            spacing that are only exhibited between conspecifics.[6]
