                <h3>Who is this smart fella?</h3>
                <p>
                    The capybara, scientifically known as Hydrochoerus 
                    hydrochaeris, is the largest rodent in the world. Adult 
                    capybaras can weigh up to 145 pounds and measure over 4 
                    feet in length. They have a chunky, barrel-shaped body 
                    covered in coarse, brown fur, small ears, and webbed feet 
                    which aid in swimming. These gentle rodents are native to 
                    South America, thriving in savannas and dense forests near 
                    bodies of water.

                <h3>Where do they live?</h3>
                <p>
                    Capybaras are semi-aquatic mammals found throughout South 
                    America. They live in groups near rivers, ponds, and 
                    marshes. These environments provide the lush vegetation 
                    that makes up their diet and offer protection from 
                    predators. Capybaras are excellent swimmers and can remain 
                    submerged underwater for up to five minutes to evade danger.

                <h3>What about their diet?</h3>
                <p>
                    Capybaras are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses and 
                    aquatic plants. They are known for their unique digestive 
                    system that allows them to extract nutrients efficiently 
                    from tough plant material. Social animals by nature, 
                    capybaras live in groups of 10-20 and can reach up to 100, 
                    with a dominant male leading the group. They communicate 
                    through various vocalizations and scent markings.

                <h3>Give me some fun facts!</h3>
                <p>
                    Capybaras are excellent swimmers and can sleep underwater, 
                    keeping their noses just above the waterline. They can eat 
                    up to eight pounds of grass per day. Capybaras are known to 
                    be friends with everyone, often seen interacting peacefully 
                    with a variety of other animals.
