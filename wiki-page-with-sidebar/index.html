                            The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul), also known as 
                            the manul, is a small wild cat with long and dense 
                            light grey fur, and rounded ears set low on the 
                            sides of the head. Its head-and-body length ranges 
                            from 46 to 65 cm (18 to 26 in) with a 21 to 
                            31 cm (8.3 to 12.2 in) long bushy tail. It is well 
                            camouflaged and adapted to the cold continental 
                            climate in its native range, which receives little 
                            rainfall and experiences a wide 
                            range of temperatures.

                            The Pallas's cat was first described in 1776 by 
                            Peter Simon Pallas, who observed it in the vicinity 
                            of Lake Baikal. Since then, it has been recorded 
                            across a large region in Central Asia, albeit in 
                            widely spaced sites from the Caucasus, Iranian 
                            Plateau, Hindu Kush, parts of the Himalayas, Tibetan 
                            Plateau to the Altai-Sayan region and South Siberian 
                            Mountains. It inhabits rocky montane grasslands and 
                            shrublands, where the snow cover is below 
                            15–20 cm (6–8 in). It finds shelter in rock 
                            crevices and burrows, and preys foremost on 
                            lagomorphs and rodents. The female gives birth to 
                            etween two and six kittens in spring.

                        <p>
                            Due to its widespread range and assumed large 
                            population, the Pallas's cat has been listed as 
                            Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2020. 
                            Some population units are threatened by poaching, 
                            prey base decline due to rodent control programs, 
                            and habitat fragmentation as a result of mining and 
                            infrastructure projects.

                        <p>
                            The Pallas's cat has been kept in zoos since the 
                            early 1950s. As of 2018, 60 zoos in Europe, Russia, 
                            North America and Japan participate in Pallas's cat 
                            captive breeding programs.

                            'Manul' is the Pallas's cat's name in the Mongolian 
                            language. It is called 'manol' in the Kyrgyz 
                            language.[3] The common name 'Pallas's cat' was 
                            coined by William Thomas Blanford in honour of 
                            Peter Simon Pallas.[4][failed verification]

                            Felis manul was the scientific name used by Peter 
                            Simon Pallas in 1776, who first described a Pallas's 
                            cat that he had encountered near the Dzhida River 
                            southeast of Lake Baikal.[5][3][6] Several Pallas's 
                            cat zoological specimens were subsequently 
                            described:

                                Felis nigripectus proposed by Brian Houghton 
                                Hodgson in 1842 was based on three specimens 
                                from Tibet.[7]

                                the Kopet Dag mountains.[8]

                            Otocolobus was proposed by Johann Friedrich von 
                            Brandt in 1842 as a generic name.[9][10] Reginald 
                            Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic rank of 
                            Otocolobus in 1907, described several Pallas's cat 
                            skulls in detail and considered the Pallas's cat an 
                            aberrant form of Felis.[11]

                            In 1951, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott 
                            considered:

                            Since 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of 
                            the Cat Specialist Group recognises only two 
                            subspecies as valid taxa, namely:[1]

                                from Iran to Mongolia;

                        <p>
                            Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue 
                            samples from all Felidae species revealed that the 
                            evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia 
                            during the late Miocene around 14.45 to 8.38 million 
                            years ago.[12][13] Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of 
                            all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around 
                            16.76 to 6.46 million years ago.[14] The Pallas's cat 
                            is estimated to have genetically diverged from a common 
                            ancestor with the genus Prionailurus between 8.55 to 4.8 
                            million years ago based on analysis of nuclear DNA.[12] 
                            Based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA, it diverged 9.4 
                            to 1.46 million years ago from a common ancestor with 
                            Felis.[14]

                            The Pallas's cat's fur is light grey with pale 
                            yellowish-ochre or pale yellowish-reddish hues.[7] 
                            Some hair tips are white and some blackish. Its fur 
                            is greyer and denser with fewer markings visible in 
                            winter than in the summer.[15]: 668–669  The 
                            forehead and top of the head are light grey with 
                            small black spots. It has two black zigzag lines on 
                            the cheeks running from the corner of the eyes to 
                            the jaw joints.[7] Its chin, whiskers, lower and 
                            upper lips are white.[15]: 669  It has narrow black 
                            stripes on the back, consisting of five to seven 
                            dark transversal lines across the lower back.[7] 
                            Its grey tail has seven narrow black rings and a 
                            black tip.[15]: 669  The underfur is 40 mm (1.6 in) 
                            long and 19 μm thick, and the guard hairs up to 69 
                            mm (2.7 in) long and 93 μm thick on the back. Its 
                            fur is soft and dense with up to 9,000 hairs/cm2 
                            (58,000 hairs/in2).[15]: 666
