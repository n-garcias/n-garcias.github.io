            When that late-night sweet tooth hits and you’ve got nothing on 
            hand, this is the answer. Made with simple pantry staples, it’s a 
            breeze to whip up—just bread, butter, honey, and sugar magic. 
            Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, it tastes 
            like a kouign-amann but a million times easier—croissant dough 
            with caramelized sugar and butter between each layer, all without 
            the fuss!

        <h2 id="section1">Honey Butter Toast</h2>

        <p>
            You know those nights when your sweet tooth hits hard, but there’s 
            nothing in the house and you don’t feel like running to the store? 
            This is that perfect late-night fix. You probably already have 
            everything on hand—just some basic pantry staples and a few slices 
            of bread—and in under 30 minutes, you’ve got a warm, sticky, 
            caramelized treat that tastes way fancier than it has any right 
            to be.
        </p>

            These are inspired by a Japanese dessert that uses shokupan, a 
            oft and fluffy milk bread that’s basically the gold standard of 
            white bread. It’s pillowy and rich, but still holds its structure 
            when baked, making it ideal for soaking up all that buttery syrupy 
            goodness. You can usually find shokupan at a local Japanese bakery, 
            or if you’re like me and love a grocery shortcut, check out 
            Weee!—they deliver it right to your door and it’s always fresh.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section2">Like Kouign-Amann, but Much Easier</h2>

        <p>
            If you’ve ever had kouign-amann, you know it’s one of the best 
            pastries on earth. Layers of croissant dough with caramelized sugar 
            and butter baked in between? Pure magic. But making them at home is 
            a whole thing—laminating dough, folding, chilling… nope. This recipe 
            gives you that same vibe with none of the work. The outside gets 
            golden and crispy, while the inside stays soft and fluffy, and it 
            all tastes like it came straight from a pastry shop in Paris.
        </p>

        <p>
            Honestly, it’s dangerously easy. You might start making 
            these way too often.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section3">The Bread Matters</h2>

        <p>
            Let’s talk bread, because it makes a difference. Japanese milk 
            bread is definitely the best option—shokupan has that perfect 
            balance of softness and strength, so it holds up when baked in all 
            that buttery syrup. If you can’t find it, white sandwich bread works 
            great too. Just avoid anything too soft, like fresh Wonder Bread, 
            which tends to fall apart and get soggy. The softer it is, the 
            harder it will be also to dip in the honey butter.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you’re using standard thin sandwich bread, you’ll want to use 
            twelve slices and stack them two at a time to get that thicker bite. 
            If you don’t care to have a thicker bite, just use six slices and 
            skip the stacking. Now if you’ve got a full uncut loaf, slice it 
            yourself into thick pieces, somewhere between one and a half to two 
            inches is perfect. Brioche is another option, and it still turns out 
            super delicious, but keep in mind that it’s often so soft and rich 
            that it sinks a little in the center after baking. Still buttery 
            and caramelized and amazing—just a different texture!
        </p>

        <h2 id="section4">How to Make It</h2>

        <p>
            Start by cutting the crusts off your bread slices for that 
            clean, bakery-style edge. Then melt some butter and mix it with 
            honey, brown sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Give it a quick 
            zap in the microwave and whisk it really well until it turns into 
            a smooth syrup that’s glossy and rich.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now for the fun part: dip each slice of bread into the syrup and 
            coat it on all sides. Be generous—you want every inch of that bread 
            soaking up flavor. Arrange the coated slices in a nonstick baking 
            pan (no parchment paper needed) and bake them in the oven until 
            golden and bubbling. Flip them once carefully about 15 minutes in 
            to get both sides nice and caramelized.
        </p>

        <p>
            When they first come out, they’ll feel soft and you might think 
            they’re underbaked—but don’t worry. Let them cool for about 10 
            minutes and they’ll crisp up beautifully as they sit and the sugar 
            hardens. That’s when the magic really happens.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section5">Make It Your Own</h2>

        <p>
            This recipe is super flexible! Want fall vibes? Add a pinch of 
            cinnamon or pumpkin spice to the syrup. I also love topping it off 
            with a big spoonful of fresh whipped vanilla bean cream, some fresh 
            berries, or even a quick berry compote if I have extra fruit lying 
            around. It’s super flexible, so use what you have and make it 
            your own.

        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                6 or 12 slices white sandwich bread (use 12 if the bread is thin
                and stack them in pairs; use 6 if the slices are thick)
            </li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of honey</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanila extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teasponn of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
            <li>
                If you're using thin white sandwich bread, use 12 slices and 
                stack two on top of each other to make 6 thicker pieces. Just 
                make sure the bread isn’t too soft—something like fresh Wonder 
                Bread won’t hold its shape well. If you're using a whole loaf, 
                slice it into pieces about 1.75 to 2 inches thick.
            </li>
            <li>Slice off all the crusts before moving on.</li>
            <li>
                In a microwave-safe bowl, mix together the melted unsalted 
                butter, honey, light brown sugar, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. 
                Microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then whisk really well 
                until it turns into a smooth, glossy syrup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Coat each piece of bread generously on all sides with the syrup 
                and place them on a nonstick baking pan—no parchment needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 15 minutes, then carefully flip each one and bake for 
                another 5 minutes until golden and sticky all over.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them cool for about 10 minutes before serving. They’ll feel 
                soft right out of the oven but will crisp up beautifully as 
                they cool slightly. Enjoy them warm!
            </li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h3>TIPS & NOTES</h3>
        <p>
            Feel free to only use 6 slices even if your bread is thin if you 
            want a thinner versus thicker honey butter toast.
        </p>
